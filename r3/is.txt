F: update flags
O: operation
R: destination register
	though it's actually the source register in the case of ld
S: primary source register
I: secondary source immediate
T: secondary source register

0000: mov destination, secondary
	primary encodes conditions instead of a register
0001: jmp destination, secondary
	primary encodes conditions instead of a register
	destination receives a pointer to just after the jmp
	instruction pointer receives secondary
0010: ld destination, primary + secondary
0011: exh destination, primary
0100: sub destination, primary, secondary
	primary is subtracted from secondary
0101: sbb destination, primary, secondary
	primary is subtracted from secondary
0110: add destination, primary, secondary
0111: adc destination, primary, secondary
1000: shl destination, primary, secondary
1001: shr destination, primary, secondary
1010: st destination, primary + secondary
1011: hlt
1100: and destination, primary, secondary
1101: or destination, primary, secondary
